Roads and Paths
==============
* Please map roads and major paths as completely as possible by connecting them to the main road networks where ever possible.
* Very short segments that do not connect to anything should not be mapped.
* Try not to "over map" many small paths, try to only map the main paths.
* Short segments of a road or path that you cannot see through the trees but seem very likely to exist should be mapped to keep the road complete.
* Map a little beyond your task edge so the person who maps the task next to yours can easily connect them.
* Always connect roads to other roads where they meet and never end roads on Residential area edges or buildings.

You will most often use the following "Road Features" and "Path Features" tags in the iD Web Editor:

* **Minor/Unclassified Road** - This is for roads that connect small villages and settlements.
* **Residential Road** - These are roads that are in settlements but are used mainly for access to houses and buildings.
* **Unmaintained Track Road** - This is for roads that only lead to farm fields or forests. They do not connect settlements or residential areas.
* **Path** - This is for small paths that are usually used by people on foot or 2 wheeled vehicles. They may or may not connect settlements or lead to farm fields. Only map the major paths that connect to settlements or other roads.
* When in doubt, if you are pretty sure it is a road that connects settlements tag as **Minor/Unclassified Road**
