Residential Areas
==============
* In the iD web editor, use the "Area" tool.
* Draw a tight outline around groups of buildings, usually five or more buildings.
* After outlining the area, from the "Land Use Features" category, select "Residential Area".
* About five or more buildings can be outlined as a Residential Area.
* Please keep the outline close to buildings and do not include a lot of farmland or forest.
* When to draw the Residential Area outline takes some judgment, but when in doubt, draw an outline around the settlement and ask for feedback.
